The (U, J) values for Zr borrowed for [Li](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssc.2015.03.019)'s paper(U_d=8.25 eV, and U_p=4.6 eV) which using the cretiaria of reproducing ZrO2 bandgap.

**Question**
How to add U to different orbitals for one sigle element in VASP?

### polaron state configuration
#### Stoichiometric surface

The polaron state charge density localized on sub-surface Ti under five-folded surfacial Ti row the same as the un-dopped surface. So Zr substitution could not configure polaron state for stoichimetri surface. 

#### Ov surface
Ov has two impact on the polaron state configuration:
1. Injecting excess electrons;
2. Induce local lattice distortion.
For un-dopped TiO2(110) surface with Ov, both of the two excess electrons localized on sub surface Ti bellow Ti_5c.

This indicats that the distortion caused by Ov itself nit adquent for polaron formation at Ov. With the aid of Zr dopping, the local lattice distortion is ecough for traping an electron.

![gsL_Zr_Ov](http://wx4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/006VaKrygy1fxvw901espj31jd0u0n09.jpg)

Thus one electron was trapped on surface while the other one on subsurface.

### V substitution
Compared to Zr, V substitution cause less local lattice distortion thus no polaron configuration effect expected. Need to mention that V has one more valance electron than Ti or Zr, the excess electron was expected to localized on sub-surface Ti bellow Ti_5c.
