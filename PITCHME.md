## Motivation
- In TiO2 or similar polarized photocatalysis materials, polaron is commonly presented.
- The presence of polaron would affect the realaxation pathways of photo induced carriers.
- At the mean time, the state of polaron would be altered.

DOS showed that the LUMO of Zr is burried in the conduction band of TiO2.
