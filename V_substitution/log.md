The gap states is 1.5 eV bellow CBM, the gap state is composed by Z 3d orbital hybridized by O 2p orbitals. V-O gap state is deeper than Ti_3+ gap state. 

**Question**
1. Will the depth of gap state affect the carrier dynamics?
2. Also the mass difference would induce different phonon modes which may affect the carrier dynamics?
