# polaron is a tough project? Try to answer!
## Motivation
This work belongs to the project of coupling between carrier dynamics and quasiparticles. Here we focus on the influence of polaron on the carrier dynamics on TiO2(110) surface in the presense of molecular adsorption.
## Method
Time-domain FSSH-NAMD calculations were carried out for various scenaries to explicit the coupling.
## Conclusions
1. Stoichiometric TiO2(110) surface has a e-h recombination time longer than ?
2. Small polaron coupled carrier dyanmics
